# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started with JDA Debate Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding the Structure

The project is organized into clear directories:
- **transcripts/**: Contains structured debate transcripts in JSON format
- **docs/**: Documentation and analytical frameworks
- **analysis/**: Completed analyses and reports
- **data/**: Raw data and supporting materials
- **src/**: Tools and scripts for analysis

### Step 2: Reading a Transcript

1. Navigate to `transcripts/22nd-jda-fall-final.json`
2. The JSON structure includes:
   - Tournament information
   - Topic and positions
   - Speech-by-speech content
   - Cross-examination exchanges
   - Decision and reasoning

### Step 3: Applying the Analysis Framework

1. Review `docs/analysis-framework.md`
2. Use the framework components to analyze:
   - Argument structure (claim-warrant-impact)
   - Strategic choices
   - Critical arguments (for K debates)
   - Flow of arguments
   - Speaking effectiveness

### Step 4: Creating Your Analysis

1. Create a new file in the `analysis/` directory
2. Follow this template structure:
   ```markdown
   # [Debate Name] Analysis
   
   ## Overview
   Brief summary of the debate
   
   ## Argument Analysis
   Detailed breakdown of key arguments
   
   ## Strategic Analysis
   Discussion of strategic choices
   
   ## Critical Evaluation
   Assessment of debate outcome
   
   ## Key Takeaways
   Learning points from the debate
   ```

### Step 5: Contributing

To add new debates or analyses:
1. Follow the existing JSON structure for transcripts
2. Use the established analysis framework
3. Document all sources and evidence
4. Maintain consistent formatting

## Example Workflow

1. **Read** the transcript in `transcripts/`
2. **Apply** the framework from `docs/`
3. **Write** your analysis in `analysis/`
4. **Share** your insights

## Tips for Effective Analysis
