# Debate Analysis Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the framework for analyzing JDA debates, providing a systematic approach to understanding arguments, strategies, and debate dynamics.

## Analysis Components

### 1. Argument Structure Analysis

#### Claim-Warrant-Impact Chain
- **Claim**: The main assertion being made
- **Warrant**: The reasoning that supports the claim
- **Impact**: The significance or consequence of the claim being true

#### Evidence Quality Assessment
- Source credibility
- Recency of evidence
- Relevance to the argument
- Methodological soundness

### 2. Strategic Analysis

#### Framework Competition
- How each team establishes their evaluative framework
- Points of clash between frameworks
- Strategic advantages of each approach

#### Argument Selection
- Which arguments are extended through the debate
- Strategic drops and concessions
- Time allocation decisions

### 3. Critical Arguments Analysis

For debates involving critiques (K):
- **Link**: How the affirmative connects to the criticism
- **Impact**: The implications of the criticism
- **Alternative**: The negative's proposed solution
- **Framework**: How the critique challenges traditional policy evaluation

### 4. Flow Analysis

#### Tracking Arguments
1. Initial presentation
2. Responses and refutation
3. Extensions and development
4. Final crystallization

#### Dropped Arguments
- Identifying conceded points
- Strategic implications of drops
- Judge's likely evaluation

### 5. Cross-Examination Analysis

#### Question Types
- Clarification questions
- Setup questions for arguments
- Attempts to generate contradictions

#### Response Strategies
- Direct answers
- Reframing questions
- Strategic non-answers

### 6. Speaking Skills Assessment

#### Delivery
- Clarity and speed
- Organization and signposting
- Persuasiveness

#### Technical Execution
- Line-by-line refutation
- Argument comparison
- Impact calculus

## Application to 22nd JDA Fall Final

### Key Analytical Points

1. **Framework Debate**: Traditional policy framework vs. critical framework
2. **Discourse Analysis**: How the negative's critique challenges fundamental assumptions
3. **Solvency Debate**: Whether raising minimum wage achieves affirmative's goals
4. **Impact Comparison**: Material benefits vs. discursive violence

### Specific Questions for Analysis

1. How does the negative's critique link to the affirmative's case?
2. What is the role of the ballot according to each team?
3. How do the teams handle the framework debate?
4. What are the key voting issues in the final rebuttals?

## Evaluation Criteria

### Judge's Decision Framework
1. Which framework should be used for evaluation?
2. Under that framework, which impacts are most significant?
3. Which team better executes their strategy?
4. Are there any conceded arguments that become voting issues?

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding different debate paradigms
- Recognizing strategic choices in argument selection
- Appreciating the complexity of critical arguments
- Developing skills in comparative analysis

## Best Practices for Analysis

1. **Objectivity**: Analyze arguments based on their presentation, not personal beliefs
2. **Completeness**: Track all arguments through their development
3. **Context**: Consider the strategic environment of each speech
4. **Clarity**: Present analysis in accessible language
5. **Depth**: Go beyond surface-level description to strategic implications
